👋 Hi, I’m @vintagelock, but you can call me Ben Lewis.
👀 I have a fascination with all things file systems and the Windows kernel, especially when cryptography gets involved.
🌱 Right now, I’m learning to appreciate the little things in life.
💞️ Always open to collaborating—let's build something cool!
📫 Reach out through the usual channels; I’m just a message away.
🎧 Currently jamming to some heavy tunes.
🎮 Big fan of MMOs, though SWG will always hold a special place in my heart.
🧠 Navigating the daily grind with anxiety and OCD—one step at a time.
